//The if-else statement is used to execute both the true part and the false part of a given condition. If the condition is true, the if block code is executed and if the condition is false, the else block code is executed.
let num1 = 45;
let num2 = 100;
if (num1 < num2) {
    console.log("45 is less tnan 100");
} else {
    console.log("100 is great than 45");
}
// Example 1: If statement is executed because it is true 45 is less than 100.

let num3 = 25;
let num4 = 30;
if (num3 > num4) {
    console.log("25 is greater than 30");
} else {
    console.log("30 is greater than 25");
}
// Example 2: Else statement is executed because if statement is false so else state is executed to true thus is executed fo the condition.
