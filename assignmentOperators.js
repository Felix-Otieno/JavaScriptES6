// Assignment operators store a value in the object specified by the left operand. There are two kinds of assignment operations: simple assignment, in which the value of the second operand is stored in the object specified by the first operand.

//Assignment Operator
let x = 11;
console.log(x);

//Add assignment operator
let y = 20;
y += 30;
console.log(y);

//Subtract assignment operator
let z = 50;
z -= 30;
console.log(z);

//Multiple assignment operator
let i = 20;
i *= 30;
console.log(i);

//divide assignment operator
let e = 90;
e /= 30;
console.log(e);

//modulus assignment operator
let u = 11;
u %= 2;
console.log(u);

//Exponentiation assignment operator
let j = 2;
j **= 3;
console.log(j);
