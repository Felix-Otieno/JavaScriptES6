//A loop is a programming tool that is used to repeat a set of instructions. Iterate is a generic term that means “to repeat” in the context of loops. A loop will continue to iterate until a specified condition, commonly known as a stopping condition, is met.
//A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.

for (let i = 0; i <= 50; i += 2) {
    console.log(i);
}

for (let x = 10; x >= 3; x--) {
    console.log(x)
}

for (let y = 1;  y <= 10; ++y) {
    console.log(y)
